# ScholarMix - HackDearborn 2
## Environment
We used the XCode Swift Playground. In order to run the application, download the ScholarMixFinal.swiftpm.zip file, unzip it, and run the package in XCode.

## Inspiration
As college students, we all know how hard it can be to find people in our classes to study with. Many of us go to school, attend classes, and leave--all without feeling a sense of connection with our peers. Oftentimes, students feel more productive when they can learn with a buddy, but it can be challenging to find one that you can compatibly study with. That's where ScholarMix comes into play. 

## What it does
ScholarMix is like a dating app, but for studying. Through this app, you can create a customized profile that includes information including your school, major, grade level, and current classes. Then, ScholarMix will match you with other scholars who you would be compatible to study with based on shared characteristics. If you choose to match, you can text, call, video chat, and ultimately study together! If you aren't satisfied with your current matches, then you can mix it up and find new potential matches!

## Challenges we ran into
This was our group's first time working on app development, so there were a lot of learning curves we ran into! Considering that only half of our group had iOS devices capable of developing using XCode, we needed to find a way to efficiently pair program given our technology restraints.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremely proud of learning how to use XCode and Swift! The group had no prior experience working with these tools before, so learning how to navigate XCode and code using the SwiftUI was an extremely beneficial learning experience. 

## What we learned
We learned many topics in regards to iOS mobile app development. In the span of 24 hours, we have strengthened our skills in iOS app development and UI design. 

## What's next for ScholarMix
We are excited to continue developing ScholarMix after HackDearborn2 is over! There are more features we are interested in implementing, such as group study sessions and multi-language support. Our team is really passionate about this project, and we all eager to continue developing a mobile app that we are all extremely fond of.
